    title: Algae # required
    description: |      # required
      This dataset includes all digitized algae in the UBC collection, encompassing approximately 80% of the collection. The algal collection is composed of mainly macroscopic algae, with significant representation of seaweeds of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The collection also includes packages of organisms such as diatoms, dinoflagellates, and water moulds. Some blue-green algae are also represented.

    title: Bryophytes # required
    description: |      # required
      The UBC bryophyte collection houses mosses, liverworts, and hornworts and is a tribute to the career of Dr. Wilf Schofield, who came to UBC in 1960. Professor Schofield was the first bryologist hired at a Canadian university. When he started at UBC, the collection included roughly 3,000 specimens. As a result of Dr. Schofield’s efforts and those of his students and post-doctoral researchers, the collection has grown to over 250,000 specimens, a considerable legacy.

    title: Fungi # required
    description: |      # required
      This dataset includes all digitized fungi in the UBC collection, encompassing approximately 95% of the collection. Fungi are organisms with nuclei-containing cells that get their nutrients by breaking down organic material. Lichens are symbiotic associations between certain types of fungi and algae. The fungi are the structure ‘house’ and the algae make the food ‘chief’ by photosynthesizing.

    description: |      # required
      With 40,000 lichen specimens catalogued to date, the UBC Herbarium houses one of the largest lichen collections in western North America. We have a very solid macrolichen collection, with a strong focus on cyanolichens, especially the genus Peltigera. For this genus, at least, this is certainly the largest collection in North America.
